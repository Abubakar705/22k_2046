Objective 3 :Algorithms.

Task 1 

•	Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6).
If so, determine if it’s an even number or odd number as well.

•	Ask user to enter N number.
•	Ask user to enter n number.
•	Set divisor =n number %N number
•	If divisor =0
•	Print (“N is a divisor”)
•	Else 
•	Print (“N is not a divisor”)
•	Set check = N%2
•	If check=0
•	Print (“N is an even number”)
•	Else 
•	Print (“N is an odd number”)
•	Display result for the user.
